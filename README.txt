Personal Project: It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia Intro Maker
Creator: Taylor Ampatiellos

How to Use:
	This program allows the user to create intro gags like those seen in the
	hit TV show It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia. 
	For those who do not know the show, each episode starts with a "cold open",
	which is then followed by a title card and the show's theme. 
	Examples can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW-ULxjelss

	The user supplies the 'intro.py' program with a clip for the "cold open" and
	their desired title, and the program puts it all together into one clip.

Syntax:
	The program takes 1 argument, then prompts the user for their desired title.
	Example: python intro.py [my_clip]

Outside Packages Used:
	MoviePy: https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/#

Known Bugs (to be fixed as the program is updated):
	- The right edge of the text is cut off.
	- Text quality is low.

Planned Changes:
	- Text fadeout at end of clip.
